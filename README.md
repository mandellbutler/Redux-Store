# Description
The Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX. Nonetheless, the open source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application. 'Redux Store' is a project that uses Redux to refactor an online retailer's website, converting it from Context API to a global state manangement structure.





# Installation
NO installation required. Please see the deployed link below.

# Usage
For this project, the open source Javascript library, Redux, has been used to refactor an online retailer's website. By implementing these changes to the existing codebase, the Redux upgrade provides enhanced management of the complex state, on the back-end, while preserving the functional integrity on the front-end:



* A user registers on the Signup page and then navigates to the Products page, which displays images and descriptions of products:

* The user selects a category, chooses a product, views details about it on the product page, and adds it to and removes it from their shopping cart:

* The user checks out by going to their shopping cart.
